# Measured, not claimed

<sub>[awesome-jev](../README.md) · [中文](measured.zh-CN.md)</sub>

Independent measurement reports in the catalogue, including **negative results** that help explain where an approach fails. These are the original authors' measurements; this repository has not independently reproduced them. Check each report's dataset, method and model version before comparing results.

Every independent measurement report and negative result in the catalogue — 73 rows — with every note and caveat tag, the negative results first. [The README](../README.md#measured-not-claimed) shows those, then the picks of the curated [independent reports](https://kydlikebtc.github.io/awesome-jev/?collection=measured&lang=en) path and the first few others; [the site](https://kydlikebtc.github.io/awesome-jev/?indep=1&lang=en) lists the same rows and can filter them further.

★ gives a repository's GitHub stars as a band — ★10+, ★100+, ★1k+, ★10k+ and ★100k+; rows with no repository or under 10 stars show no band. Rows run official first, then with code, then by band, then by title. A band is a popularity signal, not a quality verdict; the exact count, as last read from GitHub, is in [`catalog.json`](../catalog.json) and on [the site](https://kydlikebtc.github.io/awesome-jev/?lang=en).

A *call site* link opens the one file a row cites (`evidence.path`) at `HEAD` of the repository's default branch; the date after it is the day a person last read that file (`evidence.read_on`): a reading, not a run of the code. A *cited file* link is the same for a file that shows the project speaking Jev's request shape rather than building on Jev, or only an example it ships (`evidence.kind`). Neither is pinned to a commit, so it opens the file as it is now, which may differ from what was read, and stops resolving once the file moves; the weekly claims check reports that.

*Author's conclusion* is the direction a benchmark's own author states for Jev on the task they measured (`measurement.direction`: favourable, mixed, unfavourable or inconclusive), indexed from the author's report: author-stated, not reproduced here, and absent where the author states none in words. [docs/benchmarks.md](benchmarks.md) sets every benchmark's measurement side by side.

## Negative results first

Rows whose own author measured Jev for the use and concluded against it: a benchmark whose measurement's direction is *unfavourable*, or another row flagged *measured, not adopted*. Author-stated, not reproduced here. Read them before the positive examples; [the site lists them](https://kydlikebtc.github.io/awesome-jev/?neg=1&lang=en).

- **[Hermes Agent: Jev compaction evaluation](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent)**<br>
  Ported the Jev compaction approach, measured it against their shipping summariser, and published the conclusion not to adopt it.<br>
  <sub>`Benchmark` · ★100k+ · `Py` · `noul` · [call site](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/blob/HEAD/evals/compaction/jev_arm.py), read 2026-09-22 · author's conclusion: unfavourable (author-stated, not reproduced here)</sub>

  > The single most credible row in this catalog. Recall came out below their existing summariser, and at a matched context budget it tied plain recency ordering. Cost was genuinely far lower. Publishing a negative result on a hyped model is rare.

- **[worldmonitor: news threat classification](https://github.com/koala73/worldmonitor)**<br>
  Two Choice questions over threat level and category, held in shadow mode after a blind evaluation found Jev merely tied the incumbent model.<br>

  **Caveats:** `shadow mode`

  > Wired in but deliberately inert: by their own statement nothing Jev returns reaches a label, a cache row or an alert. Ships a golden fixture. A model to copy for how to trial a new model without betting production on it.

- **[hermes-jev-skills](https://github.com/kerpopule/hermes-jev-skills)**<br>
  Nine agent skills plus a CLI covering model routing, memory filtering, turn retention, one-of-many skill selection and next-action choice.<br>

  **Caveats:** `measured, not adopted`

  > Notable for publishing a use it dropped: Jev-summarised handoffs had worse recall than raw transcripts.

- **[no-mistakes: Jev review pre-brief, measured and retired](https://github.com/kunchenguid/no-mistakes/pull/1165)**<br>
  One Score per candidate file to pre-brief code review — measured twice, then removed: more billed input for essentially no wall-clock gain, and offline replay showed the candidate list could not reach where review findings land.<br>
  <sub>`Benchmark` · ★1k+ · `Go` · `score` · author's conclusion: unfavourable (author-stated, not reproduced here)</sub>

  > Removed in PR #1165 (2026-09-22). Their offline measurement found the candidate generator excluded changed files by construction while nearly all review findings sit in changed files, and that per-file excerpts made the list less precise at higher token cost. The code is gone from the default branch, so this row cites the change that removed it.

- **[jev-skill-router](https://github.com/shimo4228/jev-skill-router)**<br>
  Claude Code plugin: asks TypeSafe Jev which installed skill fits each prompt and logs the answer (shadow-first). A working reference for the skill-suggestion cookbook on Claude Code — the README records why it is unlikely to help a strong model as a router. <sub>(earlier upstream description)</sub><br>

  **Caveats:** `measured, not adopted`

  > Its author ran it on 2026-09-21 and concluded that, as a router, it is unlikely to help a strong model, which already sees every skill's description. Its README: 6 of 6 scripted requests handled sensibly on 0.2.0, 3 of 6 real-session prompts wrong on 0.1.0, which the author calls an anecdote, not a rate. It stays in shadow mode. https://dev.to/shimo4228/i-added-jevs-skill-router-to-claude-code-and-turned-back-just-before-rewriting-the-skill-listing-34in A model wrote this row's Chinese note.
