# Cross-platform compatibility

One model, many front doors — and the front doors do not agree. The same request
needs a different model string, a different field name for the yes/no type, a
different request envelope and a different environment variable depending on how
you reach it. **Porting code between gateways is not a URL swap.**

This page exists because that is the most expensive thing to discover by
debugging.

> **How this page is maintained.** The tables below are generated from
> [`../compat.json`](../compat.json) by

## 1. Model string

There is no portable model string. This is the most common porting bug.

**Pin a version rather than an alias** once you have tuned any threshold. An
alias moves when a release ships, and the answers behind it can change with no
change on your side. The response reports the versioned ID that actually
answered, so log it.

`typesafe/jev-1` does not exist on any surface. It appears in no documentation
and is the single most repeated fabrication about this model.

## 2. The yes/no primitive is named twice

This one silently changes your code, not just your config.

| [rig (Rust)](https://github.com/0xPlaygrounds/rig) | `noul` | `.noul` |
<!-- yesno:end -->

Both spellings are the same primitive. Moving from an evaluation-API path to a
native path means every `type: 'boolean'` becomes `type: 'noul'` and every
`.probability` becomes `.noul`.

Note that one gateway exposes **both** routes with **different** spellings. Pick
one route and stay on it.

## 3. Where confidence lives

And on every surface: **`noul` answers carry no confidence at all.** The
probability is the answer. A helper that reads `.confidence` uniformly across
all three types will return nothing for a third of your questions.

## 4. Request shape and endpoint

<!-- envelope:end -->

The surfaces exposing `/typesafe/v1/systemone` are the ones where the official
SDK works by changing only the base URL. That is the cheapest migration path if
you expect to move. One surface wraps `state` and `questions` inside an `input`
object, so a native client cannot be ported to it by swapping the URL alone.

Three different names for the same secret is a real source of "it works locally
but not in CI".

<!-- notes:end -->

The *Catalogued examples* column counts the catalogue rows whose `platforms`
record a value the surface lists in compat.json's `catalog_platforms`, caveated
rows included, and links them on the site. A row records how it reaches Jev in
the catalogue's own words, and some of those words cover more than one surface:
a row on Vercel's gateway records `vercel-ai-gateway`, not which of the
gateway's two routes it takes; a row using the AI SDK records `vercel-ai-sdk`
whether it goes through the gateway or the `@ai-sdk/typesafe-ai` provider; and
`typesafe-api` is recorded both by rows that call the native API directly and
by rows that reach it through a pass-through recorded beside it. Those surfaces
are marked *coarse*: a row counted under one may use another. No row's value is
made finer than the file it cites shows. The MCP server's `compatibility()`
gives the same count; its `search_examples(platform=…)` lists the same rows,
leaving out those flagged as not calling Jev or only in shadow mode unless
`include_non_jev=True`.

---

## 7. Compatible interfaces that are not Jev

Some projects answer Jev-shaped requests without being Jev: a reimplementation
of the interface, a server that puts another model behind the same route, or a
harness that sends Jev the same requests to compare. They are the catalogue's
`alternative` rows. Pointing an SDK at one may work; the thresholds you tuned
on Jev will not transfer, because a compatible interface says nothing about
calibration.

The table records, from each project's own files, what its interface looks
like: the route, how it spells the yes/no type and where it puts the answer,
and where its answers come from in the default configuration. *Weights* is
always shown, because an open-weights model you can run (*open*), a model only
the project runs (*closed*) and another provider's hosted model called behind
the route (*proxy*) are different things that look the same from the outside.
*Calls Jev to compare* means one of the cited files sends Jev the same requests;
a published comparison is the project's own numbers, not reproduced here.

Each value is backed by a string in a file the row's `wire.source` cites. Lint
holds every value copied out of a file to one of those strings, and the weekly
`claims` run re-reads them. A dash means the cited files do not show it: nothing
is inferred. *Read in* says whether a person has read the files yet; until one
has, the row is also listed in [review-queue.md](review-queue.md#wire-unread).

## Hard limits

Properties of the model, so they hold on every surface.

<!-- limits:start -->
|  | Limit | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **choice options** | max 255 | Walk a hierarchy with a beam search over probabilities to get past it. |
| **score levels** | 2 to 10, 0-indexed, ordered low to high | A score is probability-weighted, so it lands between levels. Do not assume an integer. |
| **context** | 64k tokens per request; 32k for state plus the longest question | No tokenizer is published, which is why at least one production integration budgets in UTF-8 bytes with headroom. |
| **input** | text only: string, JSON object, or array of text | No image, audio or video. Pre-process to text or to typed fields. |
| **output tokens** | free; the model generates no text | Only input is charged, which is what makes per-item judgement at scale affordable. |
| **streaming** | not supported anywhere | The upstream API does not stream, so no gateway can add it. |
| **self-hosting** | impossible; no published weights | Anything that runs locally is a different model with a compatible wire format. Calibration does not transfer, so neither do thresholds. |

## SDK naming, Python versus JavaScript

|                  | Python                             | JavaScript                                 |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Package          | `typesafe-sdk`                     | `@typesafe-ai/sdk`                         |
| Method           | `client.system_one(...)`           | `client.systemOne(...)`                    |
| Question helpers | classes: `Choice`, `Score`, `Noul` | functions: `choice()`, `score()`, `noul()` |

Two answer-access patterns also appear across published examples:
`response.answers["key"]` and `response.nouls["key"]` / `.choices` / `.scores`.
Follow whichever your own SDK version's docs show, and do not mix them.

## What is not portable at all

- **Thresholds across question types.** A cutoff tuned on a `noul` probability
  is not a `choice` confidence. The vendor's own limitations doc makes this
  point explicitly.
- **Thresholds across model versions.** Pin the version if you have tuned any.
- **Thresholds onto a compatible reimplementation.** A matching wire format
  implies nothing about calibration. See [§7](#7-compatible-interfaces-that-are-not-jev)
  and the `alternative` rows in the catalog.
- **Option ordering.** One independent test found that reversing option order
  moved a probability enough to cross a 0.9 threshold. It is unreplicated, so
  treat the magnitude as indicative — but if it reproduces for your workload,
  freeze option order and treat it as part of your prompt.

Claims that circulate but are wrong, each checked against a primary source:

| The yes/no type is called "Binary"               | It is `noul`. One SDK spells it `boolean`; much of the press coverage got it wrong.                                                                                                                         |
| All three primitives carry confidence            | `noul` does not. Its probability _is_ the answer.                                                                                                                                                           |
| `jevai.org` is the official site                 | It is an unaffiliated community site running a separate API with a different endpoint, request shape and keys. Its `/jev-api` page documents a shape matching no primary source — do not copy code from it. |

| The 193.6x / 444.6x / 67.8% figures are measured | They are vendor-run, with reference answers derived from other models' judgements rather than human ground truth. The vendor's own launch post calls the headline numbers an upper bound.                   |
