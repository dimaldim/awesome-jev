# Retry control

<sub>[awesome-jev](../../README.md) · [中文](retry-control.zh-CN.md)</sub>

_Decide whether a failed step is worth retrying._

Every catalogued example of this decision — 7 of them. The same rows, with caveats, are in [the index](../../README.md#retry-control); [the site](https://kydlikebtc.github.io/awesome-jev/?p=retry-control&lang=en) can filter them further by language, primitive and kind.

Design notes for this decision are in [docs/patterns.md](../patterns.md#retry-control): what it decides and which primitive shapes it, and, where one is written, when not to use a decision model for it.

Evidence recorded for this pattern's rows (reports counted, not a verdict; a row may count more than once): official documentation 0 · call site 6 · wire shape 1 · example only 0 · independent reports 0 · negative results 0 · no file cited 0. “Independent” = a benchmark not flagged vendor-reported, not reproduced by this repository. [Every pattern side by side](../shape.md#evidence-by-decision-pattern).

## Official material

The catalogue files nothing TypeSafe AI publishes under this pattern.

## Examples in this repository

This repository ships no example of this pattern; [`examples/`](../../examples/) has the ones it does.

## The full list

★ gives a repository's GitHub stars as a band — ★10+, ★100+, ★1k+, ★10k+ and ★100k+; rows with no repository or under 10 stars show no band. Rows run official first, then with code, then by band, then by title. A band is a popularity signal, not a quality verdict; the exact count, as last read from GitHub, is in [`catalog.json`](../../catalog.json) and on [the site](https://kydlikebtc.github.io/awesome-jev/?lang=en).

A *call site* link opens the one file a row cites (`evidence.path`) at `HEAD` of the repository's default branch; the date after it is the day a person last read that file (`evidence.read_on`): a reading, not a run of the code. A *cited file* link is the same for a file that shows the project speaking Jev's request shape rather than building on Jev, or only an example it ships (`evidence.kind`). Neither is pinned to a commit, so it opens the file as it is now, which may differ from what was read, and stops resolving once the file moves; the weekly claims check reports that.
