# Structured extraction

<sub>[awesome-jev](../../README.md) · [中文](data-extraction.zh-CN.md)</sub>

_Pull typed fields out of messy text by choosing among candidates rather than generating them._

Every catalogued example of this decision — 17 of them. The same rows, with caveats, are in [the index](../../README.md#structured-extraction); [the site](https://kydlikebtc.github.io/awesome-jev/?p=data-extraction&lang=en) can filter them further by language, primitive and kind.

Design notes for this decision are in [docs/patterns.md](../patterns.md#data-extraction): what it decides and which primitive shapes it, and, where one is written, when not to use a decision model for it.

Evidence recorded for this pattern's rows (reports counted, not a verdict; a row may count more than once): official documentation 4 · call site 13 · wire shape 0 · example only 0 · independent reports 1 · negative results 0 · no file cited 4. “Independent” = a benchmark not flagged vendor-reported, not reproduced by this repository. [Every pattern side by side](../shape.md#evidence-by-decision-pattern).

This repository ships no example of this pattern; [`examples/`](../../examples/) has the ones it does.

## The full list

★ gives a repository's GitHub stars as a band — ★10+, ★100+, ★1k+, ★10k+ and ★100k+; rows with no repository or under 10 stars show no band. Rows run official first, then with code, then by band, then by title. A band is a popularity signal, not a quality verdict; the exact count, as last read from GitHub, is in [`catalog.json`](../../catalog.json) and on [the site](https://kydlikebtc.github.io/awesome-jev/?lang=en).

A *call site* link opens the one file a row cites (`evidence.path`) at `HEAD` of the repository's default branch; the date after it is the day a person last read that file (`evidence.read_on`): a reading, not a run of the code. A *cited file* link is the same for a file that shows the project speaking Jev's request shape rather than building on Jev, or only an example it ships (`evidence.kind`). Neither is pinned to a commit, so it opens the file as it is now, which may differ from what was read, and stops resolving once the file moves; the weekly claims check reports that.

- **[Cookbook: Date extraction](https://docs.typesafe.ai/cookbooks/date_extraction_cookbook)** ⭐ — Extracts absolute and relative dates by asking for the parts a document names, then resolving and validating them in code with confidence-based review.
  <sub>`Official docs` · `Py`</sub>

- **[Cookbook: Pre-parsed value extraction](https://docs.typesafe.ai/cookbooks/pre_parsed_value_extraction_cookbook)** ⭐ — Regexes find candidate emails, phone numbers and amounts; the model selects the requested span so code can normalise a verbatim value.
  <sub>`Official docs` · `Py` · `choice`</sub>

- **[Cookbook: Structure recovery](https://docs.typesafe.ai/cookbooks/autoformat)** ⭐ — Reconstructs Markdown from plain text that lost its formatting, in two requests: one restitches hard-wrapped lines, one classifies every block.
  <sub>`Official docs` · `Py`</sub>

- **[Cookbook: Structured data extraction cascade](https://docs.typesafe.ai/cookbooks/sde_cascade)** ⭐ — A two-stage mini-then-verify-then-reasoning cascade that reaches most of a big reasoning model's quality at a fraction of the cost.

Ask a trial report and its supplements your extraction form or a RoB 2, ROBINS-I, QUADAS-2 or TIDieR template; Jev points at the lines, every answer is a verbatim quote with its page, you check it and export the table.
